This is a basic website that can be used to calculate the field goal percentage of a player during the game of basketball. 

The **'bucket'** refers to a shot that has been made whereas the **'brick'** corresponds to a miss.

Field goal percentage is calculated as

_# of shots made / # of shots attempted_
